The long-held view that coin collecting began with the Italian Renaissance has been challenged by evidence that the activity is even more venerable. Suetonius (AD 69–122) relates in his De vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars; Augustus 75) that the emperor Augustus was fond of old and foreign coins and gave them as gifts to his friends. In addition to this account and a variety of other literary accounts of collecting from Greek and Roman sources, there is tangible archaeological evidence that coins have been collected at least from the Roman era and probably for as long as they have existed. For example, a hoard of some 70 Roman gold coins found at Vidy, Switzerland, did not contain any two specimens of the same type, which implies that the coins were collected during the period of Roman rule in that town.

The broader field of art collecting, for which specific and reliable accounts do exist, began in the 4th or 3rd century BC. Since coins of that period are universally recognized as works of art, and since they were among the most affordable and transportable objects of the art world, it is not surprising that they would have been collected even then. Certainly, they were appreciated for more than their value as currency, because they were often used in jewelry and decorative arts of the period.
